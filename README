Multiverse Engine Project 

Written by Patrick Hibbs, released under the GNU GPL Version 2 on June 30 2013.

Note from author:
This project is / was a way for me to spend some time playing around with C++, and made for a good hobby.
The release of this project (under the GPL, see the LICENSE.txt file.) is to allow others to use it if they find
the project useful.
As of the project's release it only supports POSIX systems. (With some not really useful support for Windows systems.)
However I intend to add support for other systems later on.

To build the project:

Make a build directory and change into it.

mkdir build
cd build

Then run cmake.

cmake ../

Finally run make.

make

Note: You can build in the source root directory, however it is advised against because it makes cleaning up
the source tree harder later on. (Where as using a build directory allows you to just delete the build directory
to clean it up.)
